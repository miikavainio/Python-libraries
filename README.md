I am focused on CSV files, mostly data from NHL icehockey games.
The figures below are made using the data from the nhl-202324-asplayed.csv (with pandas, matplotlib and seaborn)

Wins and losses ( /hockey/wins-losses.py )
![Figure_2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaecee3a-e9c7-48ec-b2ff-7a3a15aa5f3a)

Here I wanted to test out different palettes and modifying the x-axis.
( /hockey/total-goals.py )

This one was more difficult from the backend, since it had more details to get the wanted data correctly.  

matplotlib.ticker as mticker import was to test out different way to modify axis count.  

( hockey/overtime.py )
![Figure_4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6986841-0390-4f8d-977d-595b9fc994e2)

Added Shootouts to the previous figure to see differences in them.  
Minor edits in the output, grid added and yaxis modified  
( hockey/overtime_and_shootout.py )
![Figure_5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12f233cb-32c4-46fe-a8c5-662f19740188)

From this figure you can see the correlation between winning, losing and scoring goals.
( correlation.py )
